# Python for the Department of Structural Engineering at NTNU

This package proposes a common structure for Python programming at NTNU KT
(Dept. of Structural Engineering).

## Python course at 2018-11-05

Material from the course at 2018-11-05 is available
under [docs/kurs_2018-11-05](./docs/kurs_2018-11-05).

## Notebook for use in Mechanics class

Lecturers in Mechanics classes do not have extensive Python experience, and for
some it's useful to have a baseline for how to use the Python toolchain
interactively in a lecture. Early priorities based on conversation with Vegard
Aune in October 2018:

- Focus on plotting and visualization
  - The notebook user can do the calculations, that's not hard
  - Simple interaction is useful.
- Demonstrate comparing plots
  - Can we compare moment and displacement diagrams to identify inflection
    points?
- Prioritize simple usage over complex functionality
  - Crashes in lectures are not acceptable
  - Time limitations, 1-10 minutes of usage is reasonable
- Chosen examples
  - Lecture 6, slide 7: *Fritt opplagt bjelke med utkrager over h√∏yre opplegg,
    belastet. Momentdiagram.*
  - Lecture 10, slide 2: *Samme eksempel, inkludert forskyvningsdiagram*
